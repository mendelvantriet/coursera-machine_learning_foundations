# Coursera Machine Learning Foundations: A case study approach

The Coursera course uses a library named Graphlab. But I wanted to use more commonly used (open source) libraries, so I decided to do the course with help of scikit, pandas, numpy, nltk etc.. This code is meant to act as a translation of the example code that is displayed in the course. It is not meant to give you the answers to assignments.

If you are like me and want to follow the Coursera class using scikit, you can use this code as a starting point. However, dont expect strait A's! The results of your models will not be exactly the same as those of the graphlab examples. The code is also not perfect, for I am new to scikit.

I had lots of fun, I hope you will have too.
